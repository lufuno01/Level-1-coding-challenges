My name is Tshovelo Mkahubele, and I am a final year student at Tshwane University of Technology I'm doing a National Diploma 
in Information Technology which specializes in Software Development. My career goal is in software development so I can help
the world by making it a better place for everyone by utilizing the power of technology in a positive manner. I want to contribute
to the technology industry by implementing software that people can rely upon as something that will add value to their lives 
in an adamantly way, and I want to play a vital part in existing's software to make them efficient for everyone.

I come from a town where many people don't know how to utilize the power of technology in a positive manner, especially my peers, 
who don't see the power of technology that has been passed to us. I and my family we live in a two-room shack which has been 
my home since ever I was born this is where I got exposed to the technology world due to my mother. My mother used to work for a very 
well know company that was doing very good in the technology market, so she used to come back with most of the trending gadgets from her 
work and she used to give me some of the gadgets since she was vigilant about my zealous that I had for technology.

I reminsce when I was 13 I used to work with my uncle on his shop we used to fix cellphones together and everyone used to call me Mr Technician
since their all heard about my doings around the town. One time while I was working with my uncle a random guy came with a cellphone saying that
his cellphone is giving him some problems so he asked us to take a look at and he was late fo work but he could not leave without it even thought 
he was late for work, he need it to be fixed as soon has possible, my uncle gave me the phone to check it out and find  what's wrong with it, within 
30 minutes I manged to do fix the phone and the guy was mesmerised by my doings. He even told methat I need to do something that it is related to IT
by that time I barely know what IT is as time goes I find myself being more fascinated about Technology not knowing that it is my calling I am where 
I am today because of the love of Technology I have deep within  myself.
