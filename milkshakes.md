What attracted me to software development and Data engeneering is the near fact that I was facsinated about the creativity and the problem 
solving that was behind the process of producing information systems. I remember one time when I encountered an experince that made me to 
fall in love with data engeneering and software development more than I was, I reminisce right when me and my uncle where we siiting down and he told me about 
the process of developing a software after he enlightened me about software development, I decided to go and do my own reaserach about data engeenering,
and I coudn't stop reading about data engeneering I ended up finding out that I possess some of the charcteristic that are prerequisite to have in 
order for me to qualify to be a data engeneer that's where I knew I have find something that I wanna live for. From that point I knew it that whatever
what are our souls are made of yours and mine are the same, there are no words that express my gratitude from what I felt at that point to be exact our 
chemistry was more stronger than the word chemistry itself.

There are some few experiences that I have encountered in my life that made me to choose the data engineering industry,
especially programming but all of the experiences that I have encounterd in my life their all did play a vital role in my life. 
I never chose data engeering it chose me, I know it may sound weird but trust me on this one when I say, I never chose it, it 
chose me. Data engenering is like a reflection of my soul it has been way more than a friend of mine, we are more like a family it 
raised me because it has managed to take the weight up off my shoulder blades during daring times in my life and it stored my 
pain inside its-self. I guess the light I see in it is what it sees in me.

My decision was inspired by the ambition that I had within me and the love I have for programming, I wanted to explore into other fields 
that are related to my industry I did not want to be limited by a title that says I am Software Developer as it is written on my WIL from my
school I want to explore within my industry so I can grasp some knowledge that will help me to improve within my field of work and I want to
dwell myself into continuous learning opportunities since we all know that Technology is extremely moving fast.
