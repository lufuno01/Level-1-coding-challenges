I reminisce right where I was sitting on the floor where I wrote my first program, on the floor of my cluttered bedroom at res surrounded by books,magazines and papers which I have not read in months. I could not comprehend why I merely did not want to read them anymore. I guess I was getting older, and it scared the hell out of me. I put my fears on the c++ complier, not even really aiming to write successful program . I just let the syntax flow out of my hands, I could not even remember the sound of my books when the wind used to rifle the pages. 

I learned how to code at the tertiary level I was taught how to code using c++, visual studio, and embarcadero. I am grateful for the chance and the wisdom that has been passed to me by my former lectures. They taught me a lot of things, their also passed me some fundamental advice that will lead me to a fruitful and successful career as a coder,even though the journey had some unforeseen difficulties. The relevant experience that I currently possessed regarding c++ and visual studio we used to use c++ for writing programs that will output the final results and embarcadero we were using it to write a code that will produce the required graphical user interface. This is the only modulethat showed me flames but I managed to show it flames at the end.

Last semester we were doing a final project which determines if you are ready to go out and join the industry or not. We were instructed that we should not use the languages that we were taught with we should try other languages. So I learned how to develop a website using Html, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MYSQL DBMS, and PhpMyAdmin. And at the end, I and my team managed to create a successful website that was required as a final project. One thing I like about scripting language and programming once you learn how to be efficient in one language the transition is not that difficult that is why I am not having that hard times whenn it comes to the syntax was not that hard on my side the only thing that I am currently having hard times with is adapting to the continually changing environment.
